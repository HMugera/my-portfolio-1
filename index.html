            I'm a young adult from Eldoret who loves cook,dance and sing but isnt good at any of the afermention activitiesüòÅ I love interacting with people and ,oh yes I love technology and coding.
            I would describe myself as a passionate ethusiastic individual with a high affinity for problem solving and socializing. I also find alot of fulfilment in being able to create solutins toproblems people face.

            I enjoy how an individual is able to  create art on the browser by making websites that is why i aspire to become a frontend developer. I came to Moringa to learn how to do this and actually be able to make websites and programs that meet users needs and actaully help solve issues that people face on a day to day basisand in turn draw both social and economic value from this skill, for both  my self and the community around me.
